The CARE 2025 will take place as a satellite event of MICCAI 2025 on **September 23** in Daejeon, South Korea. 

## Call for Papers

CARE 2025 aims to encourage the development of novel and effective methods that facilitate the translation of medical AI into real-world clinical practice. We welcome all the participants of CARE 2025 to submit their methodological contributions on four CARE topics:

**CARE-Cardiac**: Unified Cardiac Sturcture and Pathology Segmentation

**CARE-Myops**: Myocardial Pathology Segmentation

**CARE-WHS**: Whole Heart Segmentation

**CARE-Liver**: Liver Segmentation and Fibrosis Staging

All accepted papers will be made available by [Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs). 

The CARE 2025 commitee can been found at [organizer](https://zmic.org.cn/care_2025/organizers/) page.

## Manuscript Preparation and Author Guidelines

Listed below are official requirements for preparing and submitting a manuscript to CARE 2025. **Failure to abide by any of the following requirements may result in desk rejection of the manuscript**:

- **Manuscript template**: Papers must be submitted electronically in searchable pdf format following the guidelines for authors and LaTeX and MS Word templates available at [Lecture Notes in Computer Science](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines). Manuscripts should be up to 8-pages (text, figures and tables) plus up to 2 pages of references. To provide flexibility, the submission may be extended up to a maximum of **12 pages**, including both content and references. No modifications to the templates are permitted. 
- **Anonymization**: The CARE 2025 review process is **double-blind**, i.e. the names of the authors and reviewers are not revealed to each other. Papers must thus be properly anonymized before submission and breach of anonymization will lead to automatic desk rejection.
- **Data use declaration and acknowledgment**: Authors must declare the data origin for each track of CARE 2025, or any other public or private data used in the preparation of the paper. The paper must include the paper citations, and/or acknowledgments as required by CARE 2025 or any public or private data used in the preparation of the paper. The data use declaration does not have to be a dedicated section in the paper, and the required information can be provided anywhere in the main text (for example, as part of the description of the experimental setup).
