## Motivation 

Medical image analysis empowered by AI has significantly reshaped medicine.  However, real-world medical image analysis poses significant challenges for medical AI, including domain shifts due to diverse imaging protocols and medical centers, variability in pathological regions of interest (ROIs) such as lesions and scars, and limited generalization capabilities of existing deep learning models. This challenge aims to encourage the development of novel and effective methods that facilitate the translation of medical AI into real-world clinical practice.



## Tracks

This challenge consists of four challenging tracks and encompasses imaging data from over **2000 patients** collected across **three continents**, capturing diverse acquisition protocols, clinical centers, and patient populations.  Participants can explore each track below to access the corresponding datasets and detailed task descriptions.

[CARE-Cardiac](/care_2025/track1): Unified Cardiac Sturcture and Pathology Segmentation 

[CARE-Myops](/care_2025/track2): Myocardial Pathology Segmentation

[CARE-WHS](/care_2025/track3): Whole Heart Segmentation 

[CARE-Liver](/care_2025/track4): Liver Segmentation and Fibrosis Staging
